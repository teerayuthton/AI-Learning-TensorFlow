# Forward propagation
- This code demonstrates a simple forward propagation in a neural network.
- It calculates the output of a neural network with one hidden layer.


## The example how to predicting how many transactions a user will make at bank.
- First layer (Left) we have 2 children and 3 accounts
- Second layer (Hidden later)(Center)
The weights are defined for each node, and the output is calculated by multiplying the inputs with the weights.
- Output layer (Right) calculate from Hidden layers.
